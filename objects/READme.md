Paragraph text

Here is an example:

```

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

var evenNumbers = filterBy(numbers, isEven);

console.log(evenNumbers) // [2, 4];

```

* [ ] 1. We have defined a variable twitter. Use dot notation to add a key called 'stockPrice' and set it equal to 18.

* [ ] 2. Use bracket notation to add a key called 'ceo' and set it equal to 'Jack Dorsey'.

* [ ] 3. We have given you a variable 'twittersAddress'. Add this to the twitter object with the key 'address', however you'd like (without altering where we define the twitter object on lines 8-12). What notation did you use to add this to the object?

* [ ] 4. Add an array of strings, each representing a tweet, to your twitter object in whatever way you'd like. You make up the name of the key and the tweets (just 2-3 is fine).

* [ ] 5. Invoke the countCharacters function we've given you on line 9, by passing in the SECOND tweet in your array. Add a comment what you think this function will return.

* [ ] 6. Loop through the twitter object and print each KEY to the console.
